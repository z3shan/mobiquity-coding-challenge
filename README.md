## Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

### Cloning

Clone this repository on to your local machine using the command shown below.

```
git clone git@github.com:z3shan/mobiquity-coding-challenge.git
```

### Node Version

This project is using Node version 16.x. If you are running a node version less than 16.x, you must install and switch to a compatible version of node.

### Installation

Install dependencies in the root directory using command shown below.

```
npm install
```

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```
npm start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```
npm run android
```

### For iOS

```
npm run ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
